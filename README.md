# Syntax Highlighter Bot

> Source code of [@syntaxybot](https://telegram.me/syntaxybot).

Inspired by
[Piterden/syntax-highlighter-bot](https://github.com/Piterden/syntax-highlighter-bot).

Minimal syntax highlighting bot for Telegram. Use it in private chats or add to
group chats. Send text inside three backticks, or any message containing `pre`
or multiline `code` entities, and the bot will reply you with syntax highlighted
images of that piece of code. Useful in Development groups.

**Try the running bot here:
[Syntax Highlighter Bot](https://telegram.me/syntaxybot) ðŸš€**

Written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and
[grammY](https://grammy.dev/) and runs on [Deno](https://deno.land/).

## Built Using

Thanks to these tools and libraries.

2. [svg2png-wasm](https://github.com/ssssota/svg2png-wasm) â€” SVG to PNG
   converter JS library made with WASM + resvg (no native dependencies). Used
   for generating PNG images from custom made SVG.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

**Syntax Highlighting** for almost 200 languages with automatic language
detection - power of [highlight.js][hljs]!

<a id="language-detection" href="#language-detection"></a> **Language
Detection**: Tries to detect and use the detected language for more accurate
results.

- `bot.ts <code>` - Detects <samp>ts</samp>.
- `ts <code>` - Detects <samp>ts</samp>.
- `<code>` - Auto detection by [highlight.js][hljs].

NOTE: The `<code>` ~~should be a <samp>pre</samp> formatted code block~~ could
be a <samp>pre</samp> entity formatted code block, or a multiline
<samp>code</samp> entity.

### ðŸŽ¨ Customization

<a id="custom-theming" href="#custom-theming"></a> **Custom theming** for the
images. Use the <samp>/theme</samp> command to set any theme from
[this list](https://telegra.ph/Themes---Syntax-Highlighter-Bot-04-14). See
themes in action [here](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/).

<a id="multiple-fonts" href="#multiple-fonts"></a> **Multiple fonts** support.
See the <samp>/font</samp> command in chat for the list of available fonts. Add
a font that you like by putting them in the [assets/fonts/](assets/fonts/) and
opening a PR.

<a id="as-documents" href="#as-documents"></a> **Send images as documents**.
Sometimes long code might make the image blurry due to the default Telegram
image compression. Sending them as documents fixes the issue. Use either
<samp>/as_doc</samp> or
<samp>/as_document</samp> command.

### Better User Experience

<a id="forced-highlighting" href="#forced-highlighting"></a> **Forced
Highlighting**: Replying
<samp>/highlight</samp> or
<samp>/hl</samp> to a message containing text or caption, will

- check for `pre` and `code` (multiline) entities and if there is any, only
  highlights those as it normally do. Useful if the original message was edited
  later.
- If no `pre` or `code` (multiline) entities were found, highlights the whole
  message. Useful if you forgot to format them before sending.

<h4 id="forced-highlighting-optional-args" href="#forced-highlighting-optional-args">Optional Arguments</h4>

You can optionally pass arguments separated by commas or white spaces. The
accepted arguments are integers corresponding to the position of the
`pre`/`code` entity in the message. Starting from 1. See the example below.

Passing `w` or `no-wrap`, or `nw` will highlight the text without wrapping it.
The image will scale to the maximum content length. It is useful when
highlighting some terminal logs, etc.

> Introduced in <kbd>v0.4.0</kbd>

You can also pass any of `0`, `full`, `f` to get the whole message highlighted.
(why?: If you ever need to highlight the full message which contains
`pre`/`code` entities).

Take this message as an example:

```
Lorem ipsum <code (inline)> dolor sit amet.

<code (multi line)>

Nunc in ligula vehicula quam efficitur vehicula at lacinia erat.

<pre>
```

Now, replying,

> **NOTE**: <samp>/hl</samp> is the same as
> <samp>/highlight</samp>. It's just a short form.

- `/hl` will highlight `<code (multi line)>` and `<pre>` (Default).
- `/hl 1` will only highlight the `<code (inline)>`.
- `/hl 2` will only highlight the `<code (multi line)>`.
- `/hl 3` will only highlight the `<pre>`.
- `/hl 1 3` will highlight both `<code (inline)>` and `<pre>`.
- `/hl 0` or `/hl f` or `/hl full` will highlight the whole message.

**NOTE**: `/hl 0 1` only highlights the full message; not both full message and
1st `pre`/`code` entity.

<a id="toggle-auto-shl" href="#toggle-auto-shl"></a> **Toggle Automatic Syntax
Highlighting**: You can disable auto syntax highlighting by using the
<samp>/toggle_auto_hl</samp> command. (Use the same command to re-enable it).
You don't always need the bot to highlight even the small codeblocks. So, when
you need the highlighting, you can force it to highlight the message/code
blocks. Checkout the ["Forced Highlighting"](#forced-highlighting) feature.

> Introduced in <kbd>v0.3.0</kbd> â€¢ See
> [grammyjs#57178](https://t.me/grammyjs/57178).

<a id="stats" href="#stats"></a> **Stats**: Not a very useful feature, I know.
Use
<samp>/stats</samp> command to find how many times the bot has sent syntax
highlighted images for you.

### "Maybe" features that I'd like to add if possible.

- [ ] Highlight only if the code block contains more than <b><samp>x</samp>
      number of characters</b>. It would be a mess if someone use three
      backticks instead of one backtick, even for a single monospace word.

- [ ] <b>Automatically toggle "Send as Document" mode</b> if there is more than
      <samp>x</samp> number of characters.

- [x] <b>No puppeteer.</b> Highlighting without using puppeteer. (The most
      wanted feature). This was done in <kbd>v0.5.0</kbd> by using an
      implementation which creates a SVG and transform it into PNG... blah blah.

- [x] <b>Forced <samp>/highlight</samp>ing</b> by replying to a message - if the
      message contains pre code blocks, highlight them in the usual way. If not,
      highlight the whole message.

## Setup

### Running Locally

Make sure you have installed [Deno CLI](https://deno.land/).

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcdunkan/syntax-highlighter-bot.git
```

Go to to the cloned repository folder. Create a `.env` file and set
[environment variables](#environment-variables) like in
[example.env](example.env).

Run the bot using the command below.

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read local.ts
```

**Required permissions**

- <samp>--allow-net</samp> - To communicate with Telegram servers and receive
  updates.
- <samp>--allow-env</samp> - To access environment variables.
- <samp>--allow-read</samp> - To read [translations](locales),
  [styles](assets/styles/), [fonts](assets/fonts/) and
  <samp>.env</samp> file.

If everything is done correct, you should see "(Username) started" in your
console.

### Deploy to Deno Deploy

The working bot, [@syntaxybot](https://telegram.me/syntaxybot) is currently
deployed on [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) free account. It's pretty
easy to setup.

Click
[here](https://dash.deno.com/new?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcdunkan/syntax-highlighter-bot/main/main.ts&env=BOT_TOKEN,DETA_KEY)
to deploy to Deno Deploy.

> If you're having issues with deploying using the above link, try forking this
> repository and deploying from [Deno Deploy Dashboard](https://dash.deno.com/)
> by connecting to the forked repository.

After deploying you will get a link to your application, in the format
`https://<appname>.deno.dev`.

Open browser and go to the link down below.

- Replace the `<BOT_TOKEN>` with your `BOT_TOKEN`.
- Replace `<APP_URL>` with the link to your application.

```
https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<APP_URL>/<BOT_TOKEN>&drop_pending_updates=true
```

This will set the bot's webhook to the deployed application, so Telegram will
send updates there and it will be able to handle them there.
